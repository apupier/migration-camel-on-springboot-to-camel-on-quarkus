This is an example repository on how to migrate 2 small examples, one with http-> http and another one with kafka -> kafka routes.

Open the sub-folders to-migrate-xxx and then follow the migration-instructions.md files.

I recommend to start with the http example which is slightly simpler.

Then you can use the kafka one where it is also explained how to go native.
